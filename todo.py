# Change data type of Obs space to float
# Use Add a different channel containing tile counts.
# Add something with respect to the player simulation in the observation space.
# Use diagonal instead of a 2D mask.
# Use single step learning using a big observation space and action mask
# Invert and try
# Consider starting and end point within the mask
# Create random point in the mask and ensure the cell is reachable.


# Last used action space in observation matrix
